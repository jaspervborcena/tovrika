# Use Modern Material Syntax

## Modern Material Styling

- For Angular Material v19+, use the new sass mixin `mat.theme` to initialize the components styling. An example is below. Never use the old material mixins for v19+ versions.

```scss
@use '@angular/material' as mat;

html {
  color-scheme: light dark;
  @include mat.theme((
    color: mat.$violet-palette,
    typography: Roboto,
    density: 0
  ));
}
```

## Individual components styling

- For individual components styling changes, use the new mixins for overriding specific design tokens for the components.

An example for the material button is follows:

```scss
@use '@angular/material' as mat;

// Customize the entire app. Change :root to your selector if you want to scope the styles.
:root {
  @include mat.button-overrides((
    filled-container-color: orange,
    filled-label-text-color: red,
  ));
}
```

The full list of design tokens can be found on the link of each components documentation in the Styling tab. For example of the button:

https://material.angular.io/components/button/styling

- For buttons and other material components, the `color` is property is deprecated so don't use that anymore. Instead for a primary button, use the `mat-flat-button` and for less prominent buttons use `mat-raised-button` or just `mat-button`
