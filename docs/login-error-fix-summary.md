# Login Error Fix - Quick Summary

## Issue
Generic error message: **"Login failed. Please try again."** provides no information about what went wrong.

## Solution

### Enhanced Error Handling in `auth.service.ts`

#### 1. **Specific Error Messages**
Now detects and shows Firebase error codes with user-friendly messages:

| Firebase Code | User Sees |
|--------------|-----------|
| `auth/user-not-found` | "No account found with this email address." |
| `auth/wrong-password` | "Incorrect password. Please try again." |
| `auth/invalid-email` | "Please enter a valid email address." |
| `auth/user-disabled` | "This account has been disabled. Please contact support." |
| `auth/too-many-requests` | "Too many failed attempts. Please try again later." |
| `auth/network-request-failed` | "Network error. Please check your connection and try again." |
| `auth/invalid-credential` | "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials." |

#### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed console logs for debugging:

```
🔐 Starting hybrid login process for: user@example.com
🔐 Network status: Online
🌐 Online - attempting Firebase authentication
❌ Firebase authentication failed
